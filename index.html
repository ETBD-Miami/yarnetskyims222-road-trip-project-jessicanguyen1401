      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Welcome to Ho Chi Minh City, or a more familiar name, Saigon where all the hustling and bustling atmosphere of the city breathes life into the vitality of the culture here. Located in the heart of Southern Viet Nam, Ho Chi Minh City is one of the top attraction of the country, as well as an emerging international business destination. From the finest of hotels to the cheapest of guesthouses, the classiest of restaurants to the tastiest of street stalls, the choicest of boutiques to the scrum of the markets, HCMC is a city of energy and discovery. 
          
          Wander through timeless alleys to incense-infused temples before negotiating chic designer malls beneath sleek 21st-century skyscrapers. The ghosts of the past live on in buildings that one generation ago witnessed a city in turmoil, but now the real beauty of the former Saigon’s urban collage is the seamless blending of these two worlds into one exciting mass. </p>

       <h2>Things to know before you go</h2>
         <p>After the "Fall of Saigon," which the victors called the "Liberation of Saigon," many Saigon residents fled to the U.S. and elsewhere, creating a Vietnamese diaspora. While in this sense the city shrank, it grew in that its borders were expanded to include its suburbs and its whole province. Today, Ho Chi Minh City is the largest city in Vietnam, having eight million inhabitants, and is the nation's economic hub, accounting for 20% of national GDP. The city also attracts many tourists, especially to its French District, museums and its numerous cinemas. To explore Ho Chi Minh city, you can book a transfer service to go around. Ho Chi Minh City's climate is classified as tropical wet and dry, meaning that it is warm all year round and divided into two distinct seasons, the wet season and the dry season, rather than spring, summer, fall and winter. The average daily temperature is 82oF and relatively stable.</p>

          <p>Brash, wild, exhilarating and a little bit lawless, Ho Chi Minh City has flourished into one of the crown jewels of Southeast Asia. Bangkok may still be better traveled and Hanoi arguably more historic, but this city, with its booming economy, terrific nightlife and dizzying energy, is like no other. Here are 11 reasons to pack your bags and head east.

Whether you're looking for a stretch of sand near one of the country's buzzing cities, a spot suitable for families, or a quiet cove to escape the crowds, here's our pick of the best beaches in Vietnam.</p>
