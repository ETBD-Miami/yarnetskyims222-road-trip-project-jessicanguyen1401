            <h3>Apartment 42 Ton That Thiep</h3>
            <p>Come for the apartment building partially converted into cool boutique shops, and linger for the young, social-media-savvy fashion labels that produce stylish but affordable clothing. Triple T is a great store here selling linen menswear. Head upstairs, and also through to the back to the second building.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/ho-chi-minh-city/attractions/opera-house/a/poi-sig/1078011/357884">Opera House</a></h3>
        <p> Gracing the intersection of Ð Dong Khoi and ÐL Le Loi, this grand colonial edifice with a sweeping staircase was built in 1897 and is one of the city's most recognisable buildings. Officially known as the Municipal Theatre, the Opera House captures the flamboyance of France’s belle époque. Performances range from ballet and opera to modern dance and musicals. Check the website for English-language listings and booking information. </p>

            <h3>Cho Lon Market</h3>

            <p>Cholon’s main market has a great clock tower and a central courtyard with gardens. Much of the business here is wholesale but it’s popular with tour groups. The market was originally built by the French in the 1880s; Guangdong-born philanthropist Quach Dam paid for its rebuilding and was commemorated by a statue that is now in the Fine Arts Museum. Very little English is spoken but expect a friendly welcome if you take breakfast or coffee with the market's street-food vendors.</p>
